The code defines a function perform_sentiment_analysis that takes a text input as a parameter and returns the sentiment score.
The function downloads the VADER lexicon for sentiment analysis using NLTK.
It initializes the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the NLTK library.
The function then uses the polarity_scores method from the analyzer to get the sentiment score for the input text.
The main block of the code takes user input for the text to be analyzed and calls the perform_sentiment_analysis function.
It then prints the sentiment score and a sentiment label based on the value of the score (positive, negative, or neutral).
